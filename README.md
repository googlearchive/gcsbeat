# GCSBeat

GCSBeat is an Elastic Beat to read logs/data from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets.
The beat reads JSON objects or raw text from files in a bucket and forwards them to a [beats output](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuring-output.html).

Example use-cases:

* Read [Stackdriver logs](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/) from a GCS bucket into Elastic.
* Read gzipped logs from cold-storage into Elastic.
* Restore data from an Elastic dump.
* Watch files on a local path (possibly a mounted GCS bucket) and upload them.
* Parse JSON logs and upload them.

Note: While this project is partially maintained by Google, this is not an official Google product.

## Configuration Options

See the [_meta/beat.yml file](./_meta/beat.yml) for a list of configuration options.

Make sure your user has permissions to read files on the bucket and write metadata.
GCSBeat marks objects as being processed using metadata keys.

### Example Configurations

Read archived redis logs from the local filesystem hourly and delete them after upload:

```yaml
gcsbeat:
  interval: 60m
  bucket_id: "file:///var/log/redis"
  delete: true
  file_matches: "*.log.gz"
  codec: "text"
  unpack_gzip: true
```

Read Stackdriver logs from a bucket:

```yaml
gcsbeat:
  bucket_id: my_log_bucket
  json_key_file: /path/to/key.json
  file_matches: "*.json"
  codec: "json-stream"
```

Read files into two separate Elastic clusters:

```yaml
# Cluster 1 beat
gcsbeat:
  bucket_id: my_log_bucket
  json_key_file: /region-one-key.json
  metadata_key: "region-one-beat"
  
# Cluster 2 beat
gcsbeat:
  bucket_id: my_log_bucket
  json_key_file: /disaster-recovery-key.json
  file_matches: "*.log"
  metadata_key: "disaster-recovery-beat"
```

Read data from a read-only bucket:

```yaml
gcsbeat:
  bucket_id: read_only_log_bucket
  json_key_file: /path/to/key.json
  file_matches: "*.log"
  processed_db_path: "processed_file_list.db"
```

## Getting Started with GCSBeat

You can either download GCSBeat compiled binaries or build them yourself.

### Download

1. Download a binary for your system on the [releases page](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsbeat/releases).
2. Extract the archive and edit `gcsbeat.yml` for your environment. See above for examples.
3. Run it. For testing use: `./gcsbeat -e -v -c gcsbeat.yml`. 
   You can mock publishing for testing purposes using the `-N` argument.
4. (Optional) Run `./gcsbeat setup` to install predefined indexes. 

### Requirements

* [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.10
* `virtualenv` >= 15.1.*
* `python` 2.7.*

### Build

To build the binary for GCSBeat run the command below. This will generate a binary
in the same directory with the name `gcsbeat`.

```shell
# Clean the beat, update the docs and build it
make clean && make update && make
```

### Run

To run `gcsbeat` with info level logging configured:

```shell
./gcsbeat -c gcsbeat.yml -e -v
```

Normal Mode:

```shell
./gcsbeat -c gcsbeat.yml
```
